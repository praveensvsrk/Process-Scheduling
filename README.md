# Process-Scheduling
Implementation of few of the popular process scheduling algorithms in the C language.

-> Shortest Job First Scheduling(SJF.c) (non pre-emptive)
-> Round Robin Scheduling (pre-emptive)
-> First Come First Serve Scheduling (non pre-emptive)
-> Priority Scheduling (pre-emptive)
-> Shortest Remaining Job First Scheduling (pre-emptive)


Please contribute to this repository to make this a good resource for better understanding of the scheduling algorithms implementation!
